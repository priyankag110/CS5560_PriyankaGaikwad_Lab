To establish an injectable hydrogel encapsulating the copper sulfide (CuS) nanodots for photothermal therapy against cancer..
The CuS nanodots were prepared by one-pot synthesis and, the thermosensitive Pluronic F127 was used as the hydrogel matrix.
The CuS nanodots and the hydrogel were characterized by morphous, particle size, serum stability, photothermal performance upon repeated 808 nm laser irradiation as well as the rheology features.
The effects of the CuS nanodots and the hydrogel were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively in 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells.
The retention, photothermal efficacy, therapeutic effects and systemic toxicity of the hydrogel were assessed in tumor bearing mouse model..
The CuS nanodots with a diameter of about 8 nm exhibited satisfying serum stability, photo-heat conversion ability and repeated laser exposure stability.
The hydrogel encapsulation did not negatively influence the above features of the photothermal agent.
The nanodots loaded hydrogel shows a phase transition at body temperature and, as a result, a long retention in vivo.
The photothermal agent embedded hydrogel played a promising photothermal therapeutic effects in tumor bearing mouse model with low systemic toxicity after peritumoral administration.
