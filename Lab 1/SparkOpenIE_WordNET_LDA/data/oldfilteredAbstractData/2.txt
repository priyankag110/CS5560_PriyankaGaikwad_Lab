Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is defined as "fear, worry, or concern about cancer returning or progressing".
To date, there is only one partially validated model of FCR (Lee-Jones et al., 1997), so additional model testing is critical to inform intervention efforts.
The purpose of this study is to examine the validity of a blended model of FCR that integrates Leventhal's Common Sense Model, Mishel's Uncertainty in Illness Theory, and cognitive theories of worry..
Participants (n = 106) were women diagnosed with stage I-III breast or gynecological cancer who were enrolled in a Randomized Controlled Trial of a group cognitive-existential intervention for FCR.
We report data from standardized questionnaires (Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory - Severity and Triggers subscales; Illness Uncertainty Scale; perceived risk of recurrence; Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale; Why do people Worry about Health questionnaire; Reassurance-seeking Behaviours subscale of the Health Anxiety Questionnaire, and the Reassurance Questionnaire) that participants completed before randomization.
Path analyses were used to test the model..
Following the addition of four paths, the model showed an excellent fit (χ2= 13.39, p=0.20; CFI=0.99; RMSEA=0.06).
Triggers, perceived risk of recurrence, and illness uncertainty predicted FCR.
FCR was associated with maladaptive coping.
Positive beliefs about worrying and intolerance of uncertainty did not predict FCR but led to more maladaptive coping..
These results provide support for a blended FCR model.
