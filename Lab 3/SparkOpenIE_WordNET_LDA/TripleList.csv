We previously suggested that adjuvant breast radiotherapy in breast conservation therapy could lower memory function soon after therapy  and that the process might be partially mediated by plasma interleukin (IL)-6 levels.,adjuvant breast radiotherapy;is in;breast conservation therapy;We;suggested;that;We;previously suggested;that;,3
The present study investigated how that relationship changes longitudinally.,,0
We performed the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) test and measured plasma IL-6 levels for 47 breast cancer surgical patients within 1 year after the initial therapy (study 1) and more than 2 years after study 1 (study 2).,We;performed;Wechsler Memory test;We;performed;Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised test;,2

The greatest impact of most prognostic factors was on the probability of latent metastases present after treatment  but for some factors the primary impact was on the time to death for those women with metastases.,,0
The use of time-to-death statistics to display mortality benefits for treated versus untreated women helps facilitate the distinction between treatments which increase the likelihood of cure and treatments that delay cancer growth.,,0


Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been implicated in the promotion of breast cancer growth and metastasis  and multiple TAM-secreted cytokines have been identified associating with poor clinical outcomes.,have implicated;associating with;outcomes;have implicated;associating with;poor clinical outcomes;Tumor-associated macrophages;have;have implicated in promotion of breast cancer growth;have implicated;associating with;poor outcomes;have implicated;associating with;clinical outcomes;macrophages;have;have implicated in promotion of breast cancer growth;macrophages;have;have implicated in promotion;Tumor-associated macrophages;have;have implicated in promotion;Tumor-associated macrophages;have;have implicated;macrophages;have;have implicated;have implicated;have;have identified;,11

However  Grade 3 or higher hematological toxicities  including neutropenia  frequently occurred  and hence  this combination therapy was not conducted as scheduled.,,0
Thus  maximum tolerated dose(MTD)and recommended dose(RD)for phase II trials were not evaluated in this study.,,0
