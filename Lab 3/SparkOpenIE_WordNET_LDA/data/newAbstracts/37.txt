There has been concern that growth hormone (GH) treatment of children might increase meningioma risk.
Results of published studies have been inconsistent and limited.
To examine meningioma risks in relation to GH treatment.
Cohort study with follow-up via cancer registries and other registers.
A cohort of 10,403 patients treated in childhood with recombinant GH (r-hGH) in 5 European countries since this treatment was first used in 1984.
Expected rates from national cancer registration statistics.
Risk was not significantly raised in patients who did not receive radiotherapy.
Risk in radiotherapy-treated patients was not significantly related to mean daily dose of GH, duration of GH treatment or cumulative dose of GH.
Our data add to evidence of very high risk of meningioma in patients treated in childhood with GH after cranial radiotherapy, but suggest that GH may not affect radiotherapy-related risk, and that there is no material raised risk of meningioma in GH-treated patients who did not receive radiotherapy.
